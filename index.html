我剛 讀完 Rian van der Merwe 的書, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22811444-making-it-right" class="de iq" rel="noopener nofollow"><em class="jp">Making it Right: Product Management in a Startup World</em></a>. It’s a toolkit of techniques for planning and designing software products.</p>

<p id="09db" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Though it boasts the word “startup” right in the title and provides a bit of content tailored to that audience, don’t pass it by simply because you’re not in Silicon Valley. I enjoyed reading it, and I work at a three-decades-old engineering company.</p>

<p id="7989" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As the saying goes, teaching <span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> topic is the best way to learn it. This post summarizes and comments on the book’s parts that struck me as particularly intriguing or innovative. Hopefully, my ramblings will sear the information into my grey matter. I hope you get something out of them, too.</p>

<p id="85ca" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
On that note, if these notes interest you, I do recommend reading the full book. I cover a mere fraction of the text’s topics here, and those tidbits from the book I glossed over might tickle your fancy.</p>

<p id="207d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Some books center on a single premise. They make an argument upfront and spend the rest of their pages elaborating and supporting it. <em class="jp">Making it Right</em> does not.</p>

<p id="52f4" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Instead, van der Merwe takes his readers through a buffet of advice, letting the audience choose which lessons to learn. As an introduction to the profession, I prefer it this way. Product management in the tech industry is diverse and dynamic. Thus I am skeptical of all-encompassing theories about <em class="jp">How to Do Things</em>. Experience is the best teacher here. Offering a range of recommendations in self-contained lessons lets the reader pluck an idea and apply it to the task at hand.</p>

<p id="93e2" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In that spirit, I do not attempt sweeping observations about the book. Instead, this post presents a list of axioms that occurred to me as I read the material, elaborating as it goes. Does such a structure fit the “listicle” moniker? I suppose so. But here, the format meets our needs.</p>

<p id="ef4d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I once heard an agile coach announce that the most critical word in a product owner’s vocabulary is the word “no.” As in, “no, we’re not adding another feature right now. No, we’re not upgrading our coding libraries right now.”</p>

<p id="593f" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The word “no” exists to give focus to a company’s product development efforts.</p>

<p id="0fdc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
After reading van der Merwe’s book, I think he would agree. He advises companies to focus on their target market’s needs and goals and not chase technology fads or solutions that don’t fit the audience. Narrow the lens.</p>

<p id="b3be" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
He backs up his advice with research showing that market-driven companies are 31% more profitable than those that are not.</p>

<p id="a75f" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
It’s trendy these days to talk about T-shaped people. In essence, one should master a specialty (the vertical bar of the T) while knowing just enough from a smattering of related topics (the horizontal bar of the T). Combine depth with breadth.</p>

<p id="bce7" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<em class="jp">Making it Right</em> gives the concept a different spin: Product managers should strive for the shape of a capital “I.” One can be visionary and flexible (the top bar) while also knowing details and how to deliver (the bottom bar).</p>

<p id="65fc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I would take the idea further and argue that these two orientations are useful at different times in a project. Strategic thinking and defining a vision lend themselves to the earlier phases of designing a product, such as exploring user needs. Pragmatism and a bias for completion, on the other hand, are essential as deadlines loom and execution is a must.</p>

<p id="c0ed" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Consensus isn’t necessarily harmful, according to van der Merwe. But making it the primary goal of a design process often leads to diluted, boring products. Endless compromise wears down the original idea and demoralizes teams.</p>

<p id="9ea9" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Collaboration, on the other hand, preserves a clear vision. Everyone gets a voice, but decisions remain within the product manager’s purview. Not everyone will agree. But as long as they trust the decision-maker, they won’t mind.</p>

<p id="85bf" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
For this approach to work, the author points out that management must establish a company-wide understanding that the product manager calls the shots. If executives don’t develop that vision, product managers can become powerless and frustrated.</p>

<p id="d5af" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’ve noticed another problem with consensus-first cultures, which the book doesn’t cover: endless debate. If two people in a design discussion have strong opinions and stick to them, you might be there a while. I have seen these conversations drag on for weeks and still not end in agreement. A single person with the authority to adopt a solution — and who isn’t afraid to use it — can prevent such torture.</p>

<p id="071e" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<em class="jp">Making it Right</em> points out the pitfalls of closed communication. Keeping loose research notes in a Word file on your laptop might be faster than curating a company wiki page. That easy road, however, keeps information away from teammates.</p>

<p id="4bb4" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Instead, work out in the open. If your documents might inform your colleagues’ thoughts and plans, make them available to everyone in your company at all times. Communication will likely improve since everyone will have the facts at their fingertips.</p>

<p id="5f6b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Public documentation of findings, sketches, and plans has another benefit. The author didn’t discuss it, but that’s not surprising given his emphasis on the startup environment. When iterating on software products that have been around for a few years, there’s a natural tendency to forget the reasoning behind a particular design.</p>

<p id="d779" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Team members come and go. People move back and forth between projects. We shouldn’t assume the knowledge driving a decision today will be around in a few years when it’s time to iterate on an existing feature.</p>

<p id="b766" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Publishing your notes in a public space that is easy to find helps to ward off organizational forgetfulness. If new folks come on board a year from now, that’s okay. They can read the background documentation to understand why the product is the way it is.</p>

<p id="e4a0" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In business, saying that revenue can harm you is like saying up is down. But our author points out that dwindling income from a dying product can attach a company to an outdated offering, missing opportunities to catch bigger fish.</p>

<p id="b44e" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
He tells how eBay had grown attached to charging a fee for allowing photos in its listings. The money was nice, but they didn’t realize that encouraging their customers to upload pictures would improve their platform’s rankings in search engines. When they finally switched to hosting photos for free, they lost a bit of secondary revenue. Still, they gained much more from the increased popularity of their core service.</p>

<p id="1b75" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The book boasts that the best way to solve the problem is to use research to demonstrate how much the firm stands to gain by cutting off the toxic revenue stream.</p>

<p id="a8f5" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Besides addiction to existing income, I think the sunk cost fallacy plays a role in this problem. Engineering organizations often pour a ton of resources into building products. Some employees might stake their reputations on them. A manager in that situation might try to salvage their project based on a personal survival instinct.</p>

<p id="3ff2" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Perhaps one way to avoid such clinging is to compliment people for building things well in the past, even if it isn’t the right thing to make anymore.</p>

<p id="40f3" class="lj lk fm as ll lm ln lo lp lq lr jo eu" data-selectable-paragraph="">
“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” Albert Einstein</p>

<p id="6220" class="ir is fm it b iu ls iw ix iy lt ja jb jc lu je jf jg lv ji jj jk lw jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Van der Merwe provides this quote to highlight a point: Tech folks often jump straight into crafting the solution.</p>

<p id="964e" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Take the famous phrase “minimum viable product,” for example. Our author takes issue with the word “viable.” Product managers typically use the term to describe the minimum set of features necessary to make a product work. The team should release the product once they reach that threshold.</p>

<p id="c439" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
But “viable” does not mean “desirable.” Yes, the thing might work. But do people want it? Does it solve their problems?</p>

<p id="7f38" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Thus van der Merwe recommends the phrase “minimum desirable product” instead. The slight shift in emphasis calls attention to the user’s needs. If a product doesn’t fit its target market, then you have a well-crafted offering that no one wants. Thus we must take the time to frame the problem before solving it.</p>

<p id="3715" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I agree with the book here and suggest a root cause: developers typically master building things, not selling them.</p>

<p id="348f" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I took a single course in studying users’ needs. All other classes focused on programming. I’m not saying such strict emphasis on coding is inappropriate, just that it doesn’t teach developers much about the business side of their craft.</p>

<p id="0835" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
A story is a time-honored medium for communicating, even in the tech industry. Agile folks know this from the omnipresent user story. <em class="jp">Making it Right</em> shows us how to apply that principle to get across the essentials of a user’s problem.</p>

<p id="b6dc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Enter the problem story: [user] has [problem] when [trigger]. Notice it doesn’t describe the solution like a user story does. Instead, it focuses on the need. The format concisely defines the target user, the problem to be solved, and under what circumstance the problem occurs.</p>

<p id="240b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
After presenting such a problem story, a product manager can provide enough of the problem’s context to guide the design.</p>

<p id="5f2b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I like the problem story as an executive summary of a larger body of research. I’ve often written pages detailing customers and users’ needs, only to find that my colleagues haven’t read them. I’ve had more success when summarizing the essentials.</p>

<p id="ef17" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The source material, however, comes in handy when someone disputes my summary. Then, since the person is engaged, the opportunity has arrived to cover the topic in depth.</p>

<p id="478d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m going to guess that just about everyone in the tech industry has at least heard of Agile, even if they’re not fully practicing it. The author cautions Agile practitioners to note that being nimble and iterative is not an excuse to stop planning or crafting a long-term vision.</p>

<p id="f83a" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Agile product managers must still select a target market and identify problems to solve. Products need a direction, even if that direction changes a bit from sprint to sprint as more information becomes available.</p>

<p id="7b18" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Furthermore, while Agile fosters iteration, it doesn’t provide for variation. When should we scrap a product or take it in a radically new direction? The Agile product owners’ toolkit — such as grooming the backlog and writing user stories — doesn’t answer these questions. Thus the traditional emphasis of product managers still has value here.</p>

<p id="544d" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As an Agile product owner myself, I agree that we should view the role as distinct from product management. Product ownership is more tactical, focusing on implementing a provided product strategy and explaining that implementation to development teams.</p>

<p id="c97c" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
While a product owner can be the product manager, when she isn’t, she needs insight into the product’s vision to do her job well.</p>

<p id="eb85" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As I mentioned at the start, I’ve only covered a smattering of the insights in Rian van der Merwe’s<em class="jp"> </em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22811444-making-it-right" class="de iq" rel="noopener nofollow"><em class="jp">Making It Right: Product Management For A Startup World</em></a>. You will find quite a few more by reading the book itself. I highly recommend it.</p>

再一個月 we will (finally!) say goodbye to the not-so-cool year 2020. Since <a class="de ki" rel="noopener" href="/10-newest-and-promising-ui-design-trends-929562b25ad6">my previous article about trends</a> was quite successful, I took some time and did some industry research, to create a 2021 Design Trend Guide.</p>

Have you heard about the newest craze called <strong class="jo fn">glassmorphism</strong>? (that’s right, neuomorphism is no longer cool). It’s the newest trend in UI, which is mostly based on a effect called <strong class="jo fn">background blur</strong>, and it basically creates that “through the glass” look and feel on elements.</p>

<p id="4fdc" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
It was introduced in Windows Vista, then later in iOS7, but it seems it’s here to stay for a bit in the new, refreshed form! If you want to take a closer look at glassmorphism, try this <a href="https://glassmorphism.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Glassmorphism Generator</a> online tool and see Mike’s article about it:</p>

<p id="50a1" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I strongly predict that soon everybody will be tired of illustrations and 3D graphics in product design, so real-life photos will make a huge comeback.</p>

<p id="4cb8" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As I wrote in one of my previous articles, illustrations might not be for everybody. And sometimes real people and real items can make a bigger impact on users. <a href="https://ekokubki.pl/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Ekokubki’s</a> website is based on a real-life photography and it looks great!</p>

I love how colors create a magical, ethereal vibe there. <strong class="jo fn">And when we use vivid colors, it’s easier for us to differentiate and remember a product</strong>. Instagram knew that a long time ago (and that’s why the unforgettable change of their icon took place).</p>

Similar to the one above, but mixed with glassmorphism a bit… Thanks to the delicacy of this effect, I think it makes the UI look just pleasurable to look at. The designs that use blurred backgrounds look incredibly organic, warm and welcoming.</p>

Probably a trend I personally love the most. There’s nothing more aesthetically pleasing, than a simple, minimal and readable UI.</p>

<p id="9e0a" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Websites like <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-PL/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Revolut</a> (also simple 3D), <a href="https://www.sketch.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Sketch</a> and <a href="https://qoals.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Qoals</a> (also blurred background) are the perfect example that you don’t need a fancy UI, or “wow effects” for your product to look absolutely astounding (sadly, not many clients understand that).</p>

<p id="9a1f" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m seeing more and more designs that have a very tidy, conservative visual structure. It makes the information looks really sorted out!</p>

<p id="115b" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
One of the most beautiful examples of geometric structure of the interface is <a href="https://www.rituals.com/en-us/precious-amber-scented-candle-1109604.html?source=cop&amp;showbacklink=false#start=1" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Rituals</a> website. Such a pleasure to use and look at (also, love the simple but enjoyable animations).</p>

<p id="28b0" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
There’s a lot of examples of a big, sophisticated typography playing the main role in a design of a product. Some of them are even entirely based on a typography — and the result is often interesting. The choice of a typeface is often quite extravagant.</p>

<p id="4da0" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Take a look at <a href="https://whirlybirdie.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Whirly Birdie</a>, <a href="https://dovetailstudios.com/the-story-of-dovetail-and-afterpay/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Dovetail+Afterpay</a> (also vivid colors) and <a href="https://synchronized.studio/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Synchronized</a> (also brutalism).</p>

<p id="e1c2" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
This is a trend that I have the most problem with (maybe not so much as with neuomorphism, to be honest). It’s called brutalism and it looks quite as the name suggests — strong contrasts, often unpleasant typography and many problems with the accessibility and readability. But I get the overall vibe — <strong class="jo fn">the main idea behind it is basically a deconstruction of what we perceive as beautiful and useful</strong>.</p>

<p id="da5e" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Surprisingly, I’m seeing many websites and apps actually pursuing this trend! (one of it being a polish radio station called <a href="https://newonce.net/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Newonce</a>).</p>

<p id="32ad" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">

<p id="7973" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
A trend different than the others — not visual in any way.</p>

<p id="2f78" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m seeing that more and more people in the industry are realizing that many processes behind product design has become extremely overcomplicated. It’s here and it’s bad — for product designers, for clients, and mostly — for the digital products itself.</p>

<p id="203c" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<strong class="jo fn">There’s a huge need for a change. </strong>And, I believe it’s slowly starting to change. I strongly think that it’s time to take a few steps back, or to look at the whole industry with a fresh eye. It’s time to rethink the confusing concepts and names, rebuild the difficult and time consuming processes and make it easier for the aspiring designers to learn product design.</p>

    我們都受到平均這個概念的牽制，凡事喜歡以平均值為準，平均的成績、平均的身高、平均的銷售額等等，我們之所以追求平均，是因為它簡化了這個複雜的世界，彷彿是一切難題的萬靈丹。 </p>

<p>
    是以平均值來設計產品，可就糟糕了，因為這樣設計出來的產品，誰都不適用。</p>

<p>
    首先，平均值，只能用來說明，是否一群體之間的差異性不大，否則，平均值很容易受到群體當中的離群值影響，而變得沒有參考的價值。 </p>

<p>
    如果你發現了一個群體，但是它們之間的差異不大，你就必須對它的市場價值，抱持懷疑態度，因為那些成立多年的大公司，早已相當熟悉如何經營這些同質性高的群體。<strong>除非你也是他們的其中一員，否則，那些尚未被注意、被開發的利基市場，才是你的機會所在。 </strong>所謂利基市場<em></em>，指的是那些需求新穎，且與主流市場的需求，有明顯差異的群體。</p>

<p>
    這也說明了，為什麼如果將所有的產品意見與回饋，都不經審查、一概採用的話，會自取滅亡，因為這樣的做法，必然使產品失焦，變得四不像，不受任何目標群體的青睞。</p>

<p>
    不過取平均值或以大眾為目標的設計策略，仍然是一個常態，比如現代的開放式辦公室，就是個最佳的折衷範例，因為它既不像咖啡廳那樣開放的社交場合，但又不至於像圖書館的氛圍那樣，拘謹又凝聚。開放式辦公室，儼然就是一個取兩者之長，兼顧動與靜的綜合體。 </p>

<p>
    想要設計出能夠迎合最多人需求的平均值產品，關鍵是要明確定位出，你的核心客群以及一般客群，這對你在早期確立 <a href="https://productlessons.substack.com/p/growing-your-product-market-fit?r=53fli&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">產品/市場的媒合度(PMF)</a>時，相當有幫助。不過我們來假設一下，如果你在初期就成功累積了一批產品用戶的話，接下來該怎麼做呢? (註: Product-Market Fit（PMF）是指「產品市場媒合度」，意思是產品符合目標市場需求。)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    你如何能夠一邊兼顧既有客戶，一邊又能開發新的客群呢? &nbsp;</p>

<p>
    以下三個途徑，都是我見證過有效的:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
1. 你的既有客戶，能夠為未來潛在客戶，提升產品的價值。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
2. 你能夠創造個人化的體驗。</p>

<p>
3. 你能夠提供不同層級的產品方案(tiered offerings)，供客戶自行選擇。</p>

<p>
<strong>當然，我們的終極目標，是要創造一個必須得經得起時間考驗，價值能夠符合現在與未來需求趨勢的產品。</strong> 這意味著，你的產品黏著度要高，且必須得不斷的進化成長，以開發新客群。以下是一些相關案例分析:<em></em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Netflix有效運用了上述的三個途徑。首先，Netflix不斷成長的影音庫，能夠持續的吸引新用戶的加入，他們投資原創影音內容的決定，是其大獲成功的原因，透過一次性的預付成本，他們能夠製作且永久擁有那些膾炙人口的影音作品，然後他們再將這些製作成本，平均分攤給不斷成長的千萬訂閱戶，這讓他們具備了極具優勢的成本結構，且獲利滿滿。</p>

<p>
    Netflix也依照同時最多收看的裝置數，提供了不同的影音串流方案，如此能夠滿足不同用戶的需求，也確保了更多的收入。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<a href="http://faire.com/">Faire</a> 一個獨立零售商能夠挖寶，並且販賣上千種獨特品牌的市集。身為Faire的專案經理，我可是親眼目睹它成為全球市值最快成長至十億的大公司之一的過程，我們從蠟燭這個非常利基的市場開始，而後邁向較大型的禮物市場，到現在則是什麼都賣，什麼都不奇怪，美容、服飾、食品，應有盡有。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Faire能夠有今日的規模，最大的契機，在於它建立了數個成功的增長循環。第一個增長循環，讓任何品牌，能夠將他們既有的零售商都帶入，第二個增長循環，則反過來，讓任何零售商帶入他們既有的所有品牌。這兩個顯性增長循環，為我們帶來了病毒式的快速成長，讓品牌與零售商數量的增長，互為因果。 </p>

<p>
    我們也採用隱性增長循環，透過數據分析與了解，我們擁有的零售商越多，我們就越能夠知道，哪些品牌適合推薦給哪些零售商，進而不斷的提升他們的使用經驗。另一方面，品牌也都樂見有人能夠幫助他們拓展未開發的市場。在如此循環下，也就為市集帶來了更多的交易量。</p>

<p>
<strong>T任何市集的價值皆與它的顧客量息息相關，我們不過是在很早就知道增加市集價值的方法。&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
    然而，豐富多元的商品選擇，也是把雙面刃，雖然它確實是賣點沒錯，但是稍不注意，就會變得繁複而不可收拾。我們的下一步，就是透過提升零售商與品牌，雙方的個人化體驗，將這些龐大的商品選擇，轉化為助力，如此才能精準知道顧客的需求。開發客源固然重要，但是更重要的，是如何贏得他們的心和錢包。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    我們也正試著提供分層方案，因為我們的顧客多元，有家庭式的小商店，也有多據點的大型商家，而他們的需求迥異，為了滿足他們不同的需求，最好的辦法就是提供分層的方案，讓他們依照自己的需求來選擇，這好過只提供單一且過於複雜的方案。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Snapchat於2017年時，在媒體界失寵後，我加入了他們的團隊。
    任職期間，Snapchat致力於開發他們Z世代以外的客群，也努力地想要說服廣告商，讓他們相信Snapchat有數百萬三十五歲以上的用戶。最後，開發的結果不甚理想，說服的結果也一言難盡。
    (註:Z世代是盛行於美國及歐洲的用語，尤指在1990年至2000年出生的人。)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    用戶增長的困境如下:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    1. 既有用戶使用產品的宣傳效果，只對他們的朋友圈有效，使得產生的網路效應影響，僅限於某一世代，而無法擴及更高年齡層的客群。</p>

<p>
    2. Snapchat本身的設計也是出了名的難用，使得那些高齡客群望而卻步，心有餘而力不足。</p>

<p>
    3. Facebook將限時動態商品化，將該格式套用在所有它旗下的app上，如此數百萬的高齡客群就更沒有理由去學著用Snapchat了。</p>

<p>
    近日，Snapchat卻似乎有了新的方向，它下定決心要更用心經營它為人所知的年輕用戶，透過系統內既有的<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21286537/snap-minis-snapchat-partner-summit-2020-announcements">遊戲和微型應用程式</a> ，以創意的方式，來鞏固他們的年輕客群，這也回答了「我們還能夠為我們的核心用戶做什麼?」這個問題。</em></p>

<p>
 <strong>事後來看，這個捨棄廣度而追求深度的策略，顯然是最適合他們的。他們的核心優勢就是他們娛樂性的發明點子，這也讓他們能夠更鞏固他們的核心客群，在不與臉書正面交鋒的情況下，創造利潤。</strong></p>

<p>
    不知道Snapchat是否能夠為Z世代，開發一個像是WeChat的作業系統，並且到什麼樣的程度，如果能看見過程，想必相當有趣。我也很想看看，他們如何在這個需要不斷開發新用戶以求生存的趨勢中，逆勢而上。就算沒有，那也無妨，我們也向他們學習到了追求深度的價值。</p>

<p>
<strong>人往往認為成長的唯一方法是求新求變，然而，實際上最強而有力的護城河，是產品本身的深度與廣度。我們習慣追求廣度，因為它能夠帶來變化。我們總喜歡追逐地平線上，那些閃閃發光的新奇事物，但有時候，或許最好的策略，是為你的用戶提供能夠解決一切的解決方案。</strong> </p>

<strong>TLDR:</strong> 消費者想的，是產品如何讓他們的生活更美好；產品設計師則從各個細節而至整體，來思考產品的設計及如何與時俱進。<em></em> </p>

<p>
    「你最喜歡的產品是什麼?」是面試常見的問題，這問題看似簡單，好像單純是在問你作為消費者的意見。但實際上，它是用來檢視你的產品思維能力，擁有這些能力比單純回答面試問題來得重要。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>如果知道你怎麼分析最喜歡或者任何產品，你就擁有更厲害的商業模式。</strong></p>

<p>
    假設Spotify是你喜歡的產品，典型的消費者可能會回答:</p>

<p>
<em>我喜歡Spotify是因為我可以無時無刻，想聽什麼就聽什麼，而且操作簡單，省錢又省時。</em></p>

<p>
    消費者所談的，是產品如何讓他們的生活更美好，這或許也是社會認同所能帶來的結果。

    (註：社會認同指的是人的從眾性，例如人在下決定購買產品前，除了賣家所提供的資訊，多半還會參考其他消費者的意見。)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>產品設計師則除了重視產品使用經驗的每一個小細節外，也會從宏觀的角度觀察，並且思考產品如何與時俱進。</strong> 比起直接給答案，應該將問題再細分成數個子問題，例如以下的問題架構： </p>

<p>
W這是什麼產品？務必簡潔有力 <em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    它為什麼重要？說明為什麼它值得重視<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    它有什麼獨到之處？說明為什麼它目前如此熱門，未來能繼續維持熱度？<em>D</em></p>

<p>
    它有什麼獨到之處？說明為什麼它目前如此熱門，未來能繼續維持熱度？<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    延伸客群是誰？指出產品首批用戶以外的市場 <em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    產品如何吸引新顧客？這能促進業績成長<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    產品如何留住顧客？這能維持業績表現<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
    這些乍看之下或許有些繁瑣，但你實際上不必逐條檢視，這些問題只是幫助你增加在評估產品的深度與廣度。&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong></strong>在面試與生活中，最常犯的錯誤就是，在未經仔細思考所有可能性的情況下，就魯莽給出了答案，如果以上架構，將問題分層架構思考，可以幫助我們來回答出更好的答案。 </p>

<p>
    我們大多數人都把問題當作考試，總希望最佳解答越快找到越好，卻忘記了，解決問題最好的途徑，往往是透過對話，而非一意孤行。<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>我們來將上述引導架構實際應用在Spotify上看看。&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spotify是一個消費者與藝術家的雙邊服務平台，但這裡我們從消費者談起，Spotify同時也有經營podcast，這也很值得討論。&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    可以提出兩種面向：1. 所有歌曲容易取得 2. 能夠發現符合你喜好的音樂。</p>

<p>
    在串流直播流行之前，購買與發現新的音樂是非常不容易的。 &amp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    音樂只能單項購買或下載，想要聽更多的音樂，就必須付更多錢。如果你能提供一個所有音樂的清單的管道呢? <strong></strong></p>

<p>
    如果你能透過分析每一首歌的細節來強化推薦效果呢?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>目標客群:</strong> 喜歡隨手可得音樂的用戶&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>延伸客群:</strong>  任何想要用音樂為他們的生活增添色彩的人</p>

<p>
<strong>對新客戶而言: </strong>完整全面的音樂清單只需一鍵可得，iPod約有1000首歌，而Spotify則無限。</p>

<p>
<strong>對既有客戶而言:  </strong> Spotify對你的音樂喜好瞭若指掌，它不僅會持續推薦最新且相關的內容，也會送你禮物，分享你的過去(比如:你的年度回顧)。由於聲音與記憶相連結，喚醒人的記憶是連結人們非常強而有效的方法。</p>

<p>
    接下來常見的問題則是：還可以如何更好呢?&nbsp;</p>

<strong>你假設的最大的障礙是什麼?</strong></p>

<strong>你如何消除這個障礙?</strong></p>

<p>
    再次應用到Spotify上：&nbsp; </p>

<p>Spotify已發展出強大的音樂推薦功能，且取得音樂版權，創造了一個上千萬愛用者的品牌。</p>

<p>然而音樂僅占聲音這個市場的一小部分，雖然需求量高但供給點相對分散，將業務拓展到podcast，邁出了其成為聲音終點站的第一步，這也顯示，它將會比整合全面的音樂產業更有利可圖。</p>

<p>
<strong>對消費者價值的猜想：</strong>既有客戶受惠於在Spotify上收聽podcast的便利性，而非Spotify的客戶有可能因給予額外優惠而有興趣加入。<em></em> &nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>對商業價值的猜想：</strong> 透過廣告贊助計畫讓Spotify的客戶使用podcast能夠創造新的潛在經濟效益。提供的額外優惠也能減少既有訂閱戶流失率，同時也降低新客戶的取得成本。</p>

<p>
<strong>最大障礙的假設：</strong> Podcast的收聽族群可能已經有他們的習慣偏好和收藏清單。</p>

<p>
<strong>驗證：</strong> 把「用Spotify收聽podcast的客戶人數比例」和「可觸及的客戶人數」相比較，再透過觀察收聽podcast的整體人數比例，估計出可觸及的人數，這能夠當作是一個基本參考數據。當然，如果要取得非常精準的可觸及聽眾人數，Spotify也能夠對客戶進行調查。</p>

<p>
<strong>如何消除障礙：</strong>將我在別的app下載的東西移過來，或者問我收聽的podcast類型，然後為我創造個人化的收藏庫。發展一個跨聲音的網路效應－是否音樂與podcast的類型有其相關聯之處? Spotify如何創造一個世界級的聲音探索之旅?</p>

<p>小問題，大學問。這些並沒有所謂的固定架構，由你而定。</p>

<p>
    大多數人都在乎局部的細節，而忽略了對整體的思考。在設計產品時，如果產品的整體設計沒有邏輯可言，無論細節再細膩也是徒勞無功的。所以從整體設計開始吧。<strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
